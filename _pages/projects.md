#### CSE Master of Science (MSc) Dissertation
Towards the completion of my CSE MSc degree at [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), I worked as a Graduate Student Researcher at [GAIPS](https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/), where I wrote a Dissertation titled ['Leveraging Deep Unsupervised Models Towards Learning Robust Multimodal Representations'](assets/docs/IST_UL___MEIC_Thesis___Dissertacao_final__Copy_.pdf). For this Dissertation, I developed three new Multimodal Deep Unsupervised Models - which combined principles from [Denoising Auto-Encoders](assets/docs/literature/papers/autoencoders.pdf), [Geometric Multimodal Contrastive Learning](assets/docs/literature/papers/geometric_multimodal_cl.pdf) and [Odd-One-Out Networks](assets/docs/literature/papers/ssl_video_ooo_nets.pdf) - and compared their robustness against missing modalities, noisy data and adversarial examples with other deep multimodal models such as the [MVAE](assets/docs/literature/papers/multimodal_gen_models_scalable_wsl.pdf). The final document and the respective code are the following (I also wrote a paper, but I still want to improve it before posting it to ARXIV):

#### WSmart Route+
For the diploma in Methodologies and Techniques of Scientific Research, I'm currently working on the [WSmart Route+](https://cegist.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/projects/wsmart-route-towards-smart-waste-collection-route-planning-system) project, which seeks to expand upon the research to develop a system for waste collection based on a real time route planning sytem made during the [WSmart Route](https://wsmartroute.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/#title) project, which was funded by the [FCT](https://www.fct.pt/en/) foundation and the [MIT Portugal](https://mitportugal.org/) program and combines efforts from [Ersuc](https://ersuc.pt/), [IST](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), the [University of Coimbra](https://www.uc.pt/), [EVOX Technologies](https://evox.pt/) and the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://www.mit.edu/). I am trying to develop new [Deep Reinforcement Learning](assets/docs/literature/papers/intro_drl.pdf) methods to solve [Combinatorial Optimization](assets/docs/literature/papers/rl_co.pdf) tasks, particularly the [Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with Fuzzy Demand](assets/docs/literature/papers/solving_cvrp_demands_fuzzy_rv.pdf) (which is an instance of the [CVRP](assets/docs/literature/papers/drl_solving_het_cvrp.pdf)) and  the [Orienteering Problem (OP)](assets/docs/literature/papers/orienteering.pdf). Here are some publications related to the project:

### Web Development
#### EBEC 2020
During my time as the Information Technology responsible for EBEC 2020, which was organized by [BEST Lisbon](https://best.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), I developed a website for the event with the [Mandalorian TV series](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8111088/) as its theme:
- [Github Repository](https://github.com/ACFHarbinger/ebec2020)

#### Personal blog
This blog was based on the [github-pages tutorial](https://github.com/skills/github-pages), the [jekyll scholar extension](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar/tree/main), the [academic github-pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and the [minima jekyll theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima):

### Software & Hardware Engineering
#### Hacker Entertainment System (HES)
I participated in a FabLab workshop hosted by [HackerSchool](https://hackerschool.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), where I got to learn about things such as soldering, laser cutting and 3D printing. During this workshop, I built the HES, a game controller inspired by the classic NES game controller:

#### HackerSchool Robot (HS-Robot)
As a [HackerSchool](https://hackerschool.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/) developer, I participated in the (incomplete) development of the HS-Robot, a robot made to traverse the world and retrieve items (e.g., a can of coke):
