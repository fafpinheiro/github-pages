abstract = {This paper describes our experience at the University of Coimbra in introducing discrete optimization topics in an Operations Management (OM) course and how those topics and associated tools are then exploited in subsequent senior courses, namely Process Integration and Intensification, Product Design and Process Design. We believe our methodology in the OM course to be reasonably efficient, providing students with valuable skills in problem formulation and solution. Simultaneously, results relative to the subsequent application in the senior design projects are encouraging, although there is scope for more extensive usage, as the tools to implement these techniques become more effective and widely available.}
